# Postmortem: Web Application Outage

## Issue Summary:
- **Duration**: October 12, 2023, 10:30 AM - October 12, 2023, 12:45 PM (UTC)
- **Impact**: The outage affected our primary web application, causing complete unavailability for 30% of users, while the rest experienced slow response times.
- **Root Cause**: The outage was caused by an unexpected surge in traffic due to a DDoS attack.

## Timeline:
- **Detection**: October 12, 2023, 10:30 AM (UTC)
  - The issue was detected when our monitoring system triggered multiple high-traffic alerts on our web servers.

- **Actions Taken**:
  - The operations team was immediately alerted and initiated an investigation.
  - Initially, we suspected a potential server overload and started scaling resources to handle the increased load.
  - We reviewed logs and identified multiple IP addresses flooding our servers, indicating a possible DDoS attack.
  - An internal assumption was made that a misconfiguration might be responsible for the traffic surge.

- **Misleading Paths**:
  - We spent valuable time investigating server resources and scaling efforts, which did not alleviate the issue as it was an external attack.
  - We also considered potential misconfigurations within the application but found none.

- **Escalation**:
  - As the situation persisted, the incident was escalated to the security team, who then confirmed it as a DDoS attack.
  - We also informed the executive team about the ongoing outage.

- **Resolution**:
  - To mitigate the DDoS attack, we leveraged a DDoS mitigation service that rerouted traffic through their filtering infrastructure.
  - This solution effectively blocked malicious traffic, allowing legitimate requests to reach our servers.
  - The web application was gradually restored to normal operations.

## Root Cause and Resolution:
- **Root Cause**:
  - The root cause was a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack, which involved multiple IP addresses simultaneously bombarding our servers with requests.
  - The attack was targeting our web application, overwhelming our resources and causing the outage.

- **Resolution**:
  - We partnered with a DDoS mitigation service to filter traffic, allowing legitimate users' requests while blocking malicious traffic.
  - We implemented rate limiting and traffic analysis to prevent future DDoS attacks.
  - Improved monitoring and alerting to quickly identify and respond to similar attacks.

## Corrective and Preventative Measures:
- **Improvements/Fixes**:
  - Implement a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to proactively detect and prevent DDoS attacks.
  - Enhance traffic analysis to differentiate between legitimate and malicious requests.
  - Establish an incident response plan for faster escalations.
  
- **Tasks**:
  1. **Deploy WAF**: Integrate a Web Application Firewall to protect against DDoS attacks.
  2. **Refine Monitoring**: Improve monitoring to swiftly detect and respond to unusual traffic patterns.
  3. **Incident Response Plan**: Develop a comprehensive incident response plan with clear escalation procedures.
  4. **User Communication**: Enhance communication strategies with users during outages.

In conclusion, the web application outage on October 12, 2023, was caused by a DDoS attack. While the incident was resolved, we have identified corrective and preventative measures to better defend against future attacks and enhance our overall system resilience.

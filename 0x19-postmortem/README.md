**Duration**: October 12, 2023, 10:30 AM - October 12, 2023, 12:45 PM (UTC)

**Impact**: Buckle up, folks! Our web app went on an unplanned rollercoaster ride that day, with 30% of users screaming in dismay, while the rest endured a slow-motion loop-de-loop.

**Root Cause**: Hold your hats; the culprit was a surprise DDoS attack that crashed our party!

## Timeline:
- **Detection**: October 12, 2023, 10:30 AM (UTC)
  - We strapped into our seats when the monitoring system yelled, "Incoming turbulence!"

- **Actions Taken**:
  - We thought it was just a rough patch, so we started adding more carts (scaling up resources).
  - Spent time examining the wrong tracks, thinking our servers were losing their balance.
  - Our Sherlock hats led us to believe it might be a configuration mishap.

- **Misleading Paths**:
  - We foolishly kept feeding the coaster more snacks (scaling up), which only made it sicker.
  - The configuration track was a dead-end; no gremlins there.

- **Escalation**:
  - We finally decided to call security, and they revealed that a villainous DDoS attack was on the loose.
  - The executives got a rollercoaster ride of their own with this news!

- **Resolution**:
  - We summoned a superhero, a DDoS mitigation service, to save the day!
  - They brought their shields and swiftly deflected the malicious attacks, allowing the good riders to enjoy the web app again.

## Root Cause and Resolution:
- **Root Cause**:
  - Surprise, surprise! It was a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack, with multiple troublemakers targeting our web application.
  - Our web app simply couldn't handle the sudden influx of "enthusiastic" visitors.

- **Resolution**:
  - The superheroes at the DDoS mitigation service saved the day by deploying their shields to protect us from malicious forces.
  - We now sport better armor with rate limiting and smarter traffic analysis to thwart future invasions.
  - Our monitoring has upgraded to eagle-eye status for faster detection, and our incident response plan is locked and loaded.

## Corrective and Preventative Measures:
- **Improvements/Fixes**:
  - Install a Web Application Firewall (WAF) like a force field to repel DDoS attacks.
  - We've souped up our traffic analysis to separate heroes from villains.
  - Our incident response plan now comes with a cape for speedy escalations.
  
- **Tasks**:
  1. **Deploy WAF**: Get that force field up and running to shield against DDoS attacks.
  2. **Refine Monitoring**: Upgrade our eagle eyes to spot potential troublemakers faster.
  3. **Incident Response Plan**: Ensure everyone knows their superhero roles and actions during incidents.
  4. **User Communication**: Develop a bat-signal for user updates during outages.

In the end, our web app's rollercoaster ride was more thrilling than we bargained for. But fear not, we've fortified our defenses and put on our capes to be better prepared for future adventures! üöÄüòéü¶∏‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
